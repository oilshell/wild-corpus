# Wrapper around run-emulator.sh that sets up a reasonable development
# environment.

# Allocates more physical memory, adds a 2 gigabyte ext3 image (hdb.img)
# mounted on /home to provide persistent writeable space, and sets up and
# distcc acceleration (if both the the cross compiler and distccd
# are available in the host's $PATH).

# The following environment variables affect the behavior of this script:

# HDA - Image file to use for -hda on /usr/hda (spliced into / with cp -s)
# HDB - Image file to use for -hdb on /home (creates a new hdb.img if blank)
# HDBMEGS - Size (in decimal megabytes) when creating hdb.img
# HDC - Image file to use for -hdc on /mnt (none of blank)
# QEMU_MEMORY - number of megabytes of memory for qemu (defaults to 256)
