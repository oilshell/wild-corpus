# A script to enroll cluster nodes in cobbler based on a cluster
# definition in cluster.txt :
#
# - If a node is provided, that node will be addded or removed depending
#   on the first parameter
#
# - if no node is provided, the first parameter will be used to choose
#   an action to apply to all nodes
#
# - if a special nodename is provided that matches a role, then all
#   hosts with that role will have the specified cobbler action (add
#   or remove) applied to them. [Technically cobbler doesn't know
#   anything about roles, however it can be convenient to register,
#   say, all head nodes first, get them up and running without any
#   risk of work nodes accidentally coming up before they have a head
#   node to talk to, and then register all work nodes later.]
#
# If any cobbler registrations were changed, cobbler sync is called
#
