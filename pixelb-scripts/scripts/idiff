# Notes:
#    If 2 parameters are passed, then they are passed to
#    the `diff -Naru` command first. Otherwise the parameters
#    (or stdin) are assumed to be diff format and are colourised.
#
#    VIM can be useful for viewing diffs also:
#      diff -Naru a b | vim -R -
#      vim -R a-b.diff
# Changes:
#    V0.1, 12 Feb 2008, Initial release
#    V0.2, 18 Feb 2008, Use tput rather than hardcoding escape sequences.
#    V0.3, 24 Apr 2008, Support Mac OS X
#    V0.4, 30 Apr 2008, P@draigBrady.com
#                         Use $PAGER if set
#                       Manfred Schwarb <manfred99@gmx.ch>
#                         Support `diff -c` format fully.
#                         Pointed out issues with less -EF options.
#                         Suggested to use the less -S option.
#    V0.5, 18 Jun 2009, P@draigBrady.com
#                         Delineate each file level item with highlight.
#                         Simplify expressions by using '&' in replacement.
#                         Use 't' after all matches for consistency and speed.

# less -K reportedly not available on older Mac OS X

# is a lot more obtrusive on the terminal as the [de]init codes not used.
