# disabling all checks of them.  The assumption is that the entries
# marked with ISUSED are always known to be good, thus the Latin quote
# at the top of the file.
#
# The exception_list is generated from whichever input files are appropriate
# for this workspace, so checking it obviates the need to check the inputs.
