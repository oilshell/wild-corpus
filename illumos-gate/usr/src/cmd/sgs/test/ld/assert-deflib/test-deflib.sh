# This test validates that the -zassert-deflib option of ld(1) works correctly.
# It requires that some cc is in your path and that you have passed in the path
# to the proto area with the new version of libld.so.4. One thing that we have
# to do is be careful with using LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH does
# not change the default search path so we want to make sure that we use a
# different ISA (e.g. 32-bit vs 64-bit) from the binary we're generating.
