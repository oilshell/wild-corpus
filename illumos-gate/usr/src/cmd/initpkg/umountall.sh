# This script is installed as both /sbin/umountall (as used in some
# /sbin/rc? and /etc/init.d scripts) _and_ as /usr/sbin/umountall (typically
# PATHed from the command line).  As such it should not depend on /usr
# being mounted (if /usr is a separate filesystem).
#
# /sbin/sh Bourne shell builtins we use:
#	echo
#	exit
#	getopts
#	test, [ ]
#	exec
#	read
#
# /sbin commands we use:
#	/sbin/uname
#	/sbin/umount
#
# The following /usr based commands may be used by this script (depending on
# command line options).  We will set our PATH to find them, but where they
# are not present (eg, if /usr is not mounted) we will catch references to
# them via shell functions conditionally defined after option processing
# (don't use any of these commands before then).
#
#	Command		Command line option and use
# /usr/bin/sleep	-k, to sleep after an fuser -c -k on the mountpoint
# /usr/sbin/fuser	-k, to kill processes keeping a mount point busy
#
# In addition, we use /usr/bin/tail if it is available; if not we use
# slower shell constructs to reverse a file.
