# rotatelogs--Rolls logfiles in /var/log for archival purposes and to ensure
#   that the files don't get unmanageably large. This script uses a config
#   file to allow customization of how frequently each log should be rolled.
#   The config file is in 
#     logfilename=duration
#   format, where duration is in days. If, in the config file, an entry is 
#   missing for a particular logfilename, rotatelogs won't rotate the file
#   more frequently than every seven days. If duration is set to zero, the
#   script will ignore that particular set of log files.
